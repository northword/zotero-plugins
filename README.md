This repository provides information of several Zotero plugins and their XPI packages , in an attempt to provide a centralized plugin store service until the official Zotero plugin store is ready.

## Submitting Plugins

> [!NOTE]

> How to add a plugin that hasn't been included?
>
> Edit [`src/plugins.ts`](./src/plugins.ts), and add an object to the `plugins` list in the following format. Existing entries can serve as references.
>
> When adding, please sort by `repo`.
>
> After editing, commit and pull request. We will process it as soon as possible.

```ts
interface PluginInfo {
  /**
   * Repository of plugin
   *
   * Example: northword/zotero-format-metadata
   *
   * Note: no `/` at the beginning or end
   */
  repo: string
  /**
   * Release information of the plugin
   */
  releases: Array<{
    /**
     * Zotero version for this release, "7" or "6"
     */
    targetZoteroVersion: string
    /**
     * Download channel for this release
     *
     * `latest`: Latest official release;
     * `pre`: Latest pre-release;
     * `string`: Corresponding `git.tag_name` of the release;
     * Note that some `git.tag_name` have `v` while others do not, you can check the release link to determine.
     */
    tagName: 'latest' | 'pre' | string
  }>
}

## Development Guide

Before starting development, you need to create a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/zh/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) and store it in the local environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/northword/zotero-plugins.git zotero-plugins
cd zotero-plugins

# Install dependencies
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install

# Fetch plugin information
pnpm data:info

# Fetch chart information
pnpm data:chart
```

[`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) is the main logic script, which performs the following actions:

- Iterates through the plugin information list, fetches basic information and releases for each plugin from GitHub, and saves the obtained information in [`dist/plugins.json`](https://github.com/northword/zotero-plugins/blob/gh-pages/dist/plugins.json)
- Saves the XPI packages in [`dist/xpi/${github.release.asset.id}.xpi`](https://github.com/northword/zotero-plugins/blob/gh-pages/dist/xpi)

The GitHub Action Bot periodically runs the `src/index.ts` script, performs the above steps, and deploys the `dist/` to the [`gh-page`](https://github.com/northword/zotero-plugins/blob/gh-pages/) branch.

> How to use this project as a dependency for secondary development?
>
> Developers can use the dist files like [`dist/plugins.json`](https://github.com/northword/zotero-plugins/blob/gh-pages/dist/plugins.json) from the `gh-pages` branch.
